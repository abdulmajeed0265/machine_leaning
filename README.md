# Machine Learning 
___
* Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves training computers to perform tasks without explicitly programming them to do so. It involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to analyze and learn from data in order to make predictions or decisions.

* Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of a series of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that are able to process and transmit information. Neural networks are particularly effective at tasks such as image and speech recognition, and are commonly used in a variety of applications including natural language processing and self-driving cars.
___
* This repository contains a variety of projects that utilize major machine learning algorithms to train data from various industries including business, healthcare, sports, marketing, and plants. The algorithms used in these projects include linear regression, logistics regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVC), decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), k-means, and neural networks with TensorFlow.
* One of the projects in the repository is a healthcare and sports data analysis project that utilizes a combination of logistics regression and SVC algorithms to predict outcomes. This project includes detailed reports and graphs that allow users to see the accuracy of the predictions and the impact of different variables on the outcomes.
* In addition to these projects, the repository also includes a project that shows how neural network with TensorFlow to predict outcomes with some few lines of code.
* Overall, this repository contains a range of projects that demonstrate the power and versatility of different machine learning algorithms in a variety of different contexts.
