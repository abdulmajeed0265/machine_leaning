# Machine Learning 
___
* Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves training computers to perform tasks without explicitly programming them to do so. It involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to analyze and learn from data in order to make predictions or decisions.

* Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of a series of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that are able to process and transmit information. Neural networks are particularly effective at tasks such as image and speech recognition, and are commonly used in a variety of applications including natural language processing and self-driving cars.
